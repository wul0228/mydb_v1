#type_implication: value的字符串中可能会含有双引号。
activator:	An activator interaction is when a drug activates a biological response from a target, although the mechanism by which it does so may not be understood.	DrugBank examples: PMID12070353
adduct:	An adduct interaction is when a drug-protein adduct forms by the covalent binding of electrophilic drugs or their reactive metabolite(s) to a target protein.	PMID16199025
agonist:	An agonist interaction occurs when a drug binds to a target receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response.	Wikipedia - Agonist
allosteric modulator:	An allosteric modulator interaction occurs when drugs exert their effects on their protein targets via a different binding site than the natural (orthosteric) ligand site.	PMID24699297
antagonist:	An antagonist interaction occurs when a drug blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a target receptor.	Wikipedia - Receptor Antagonist
antibody:	An antibody interaction occurs when an antibody drug specifically binds the target molecule.	Wikipedia - Antibody
antisense oligonucleotide:	An antisense oligonucleotide interaction occurs when a complementary RNA drug binds to an mRNA target to inhibit translation by physically obstructing the mRNA translation machinery.	PMID10228554
binder:	A binder interaction has drugs physically binding to their target.	DrugBank examples: PMID12388666 PMID7584665 PMID14507470
blocker:	Antagonist interactions are sometimes referred to as blocker interactions; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.	Wikipedia - Receptor Antagonist
chaperone:	Pharmacological chaperone interactions occur when substrates or modulators directly bind to a partially folded biosynthetic intermediate to stabilise the protein and allow it to complete the folding process to yield a functional protein.	PMID17597553
cleavage:	Cleavage interactions take place when the drug promotes degeneration of the target protein through cleaving of the peptide bonds.	DrugBank example: PMID10666203
cofactor:	A cofactor is a drug that is required for a target protein's biological activity.	Wikipedia - Cofactor
competitive:	Competitive antagonists (also known as surmountable antagonists) are drugs that reversibly bind to receptors at the same binding site (active site) on the target as the endogenous ligand or agonist, but without activating the receptor.	Wikipedia - Receptor Antagonist
immunotherapy:	In immunotherapy interactions, the result of the drug acting on the target is an induction, enhancement, or suppression of an immune response.	Wikipedia - Immunotherapy
inducer:	In inducer interactions, the drug increases the activity of its target enzyme.	Wikipedia - Enzyme Inducer
inhibitor:	In inhibitor interactions, the drug binds to a target and decreases its expression or activity. Most interactions of this class are enzyme inhibitors, which bind an enzyme to reduce enzyme activity.	Wikipedia - Enzyme Inhibitor
inhibitory allosteric modulator:	In inhibitory allosteric modulator interactions, also called negative allosteric modulator interactions, the drug will inhibit activity of its target enzyme.	PMID24699297
inverse agonist:	An inverse agonist interaction occurs when a drug binds to the same target as an agonist, but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that of the agonist.	Wikipedia - Inverse Agonist
ligand:	In ligand interactions, a drug forms a complex with its target protein to serve a biological function.	Wikipedia - Ligand
modulator:	In modulator interactions, the drug regulates or changes the activity of its target. In contrast to allosteric modulators, this interaction type may not involve any direct binding to the target.	Modulators. Segen's Medical Dictionary. (2011). Retrieved online October 9 2015.
multitarget:	In multitarget interactions, drugs achieve a physiological effect through simultaneous interaction with multiple gene targets.	PMID22768266
n/a:	In a negative modulator interaction, the drug negatively regulates the amount or activity of its target. In contrast to an inhibitory allosteric modulator, this interaction type may not involve any direct binding to the target.	Wikipedia - Allosteric modulator
other/unknown:	This is a label given by the reporting source to an interaction that doesn't belong to other interaction types, as defined by the reporting source.	N/A
partial agonist:	In a partial agonist interaction, a drug will elicit a reduced amplitude functional response at its target receptor, as compared to the response elicited by a full agonist.	Wikipedia - Receptor Antagonist
partial antagonist:	In a partial antagonist interaction, a drug will only partially reduce the amplitude of a functional response at its target receptor, as compared to the reduction of response by a full antagonist.	PMID6188923
positive allosteric modulator:	In a positive allosteric modulator interaction, the drug increases activity of the target enzyme.	PMID24699297
potentiator:	In a potentiator interaction, the drug enhances the sensitivity of the target to the target's ligands.	Wikipedia - Potentiator
product of:	These "interactions" occur when the target gene produces the endogenous drug.	N/A
stimulator:	In a stimulator interaction, the drug directly or indirectly affects its target, stimulating a physiological response.	DrugBank Examples: PMID23318685 PMID17148649 PMID15955613
suppressor:	In a suppressor interaction, the drug directly or indirectly affects its target, suppressing a physiological process.	DrugBank Examples: PMID8386571 PMID14967460
vaccine:	In vaccine interactions, the drugs stimulate or restore an immune response to their target.
