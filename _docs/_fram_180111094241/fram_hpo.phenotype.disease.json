    "Qualifier": "This optional field can be used to qualify the annotation shown in \"HPO ID\".Possible values of this field are NOT, SECONDARY, MILD,MODERATE,SEVERE. ||||If multiple qualifiers are shown, they are separated by a comma (“,”) symbol. The meaning of individual modifiers is as follows:||||////NOT:----The disorder being annotated is NOT characterized by the feature associated with HPO_ID . Note that annotations with the NOT modifier are moved to separate file!||||		////SECONDARY:----The feature is a secondary consequence of a primary pathophysiological event in another organ. For instance, although Jaundice is observed in the skin or sclerae, it is secondary to abnormalities in other organs. ----For instance, to indicate that jaundice seen in a certain disease is secondary to Cholestatic liver disease, we would annotate SECONDARY(HP:0002611), where HP:0002611 is the HPO identified of the term Cholestatic liverdisease.||||		////MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, CHRONIC, PROGRESSIVE, NONPROGRESSIVE, EPISODIC, RECURRENT, PROFOUND, BILATERAL, DISTAL, GENERALIZED, PROXIMAL, REFRACTORY: ----In general, it is preferred to annotate with a term describing the underlying abnormality, such as Hearing loss, and to use qualifiers such as MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE if thought necessary to describe the severity of the clinical involvement. This is preferred because of the assumption that mild and moderate manifestations of specific medical abnormalities result from mild or moderate disturbances of the same cellular and physiological networks and also because distinctions that are often heard in clinical practice ----such as ----“mild-to-moderate” or grade “II-III/VI” often seem more or less arbitrary. ----It is an error to use more than one of the qualifiers MILD, MODERATE,SEVERE, ||||		----etc. in one annotation. ----It is expected that software does not depend on the qualifiers being listed in a certain order. Note that Frequency information is available in \"Frequency modifier\".",
	"Evidence_code": "This required field indicates the level of evidence supporting the annotation.||||		||||At the kickoff of the HPO, most annotations were extracted by parsing the Clinical Features sections of the omim.txt file. These annotations are assigned the evidence code “IEA” (inferred from electronic annotation). ||||	||||Other codes include “PCS” for published clinical study. This should be used for information extracted from articles in the medical literature. Generally, annotations of this type will include the pubmed id of the published study in the DB:Reference field. ||||Finally, “ICE” can be used for annotations based on individual clinical experience. ||||This may be appropriate for disorders with a limited amount of published data. ||||This must be accompanied by an entry in the DB:Reference field denoting the individual or center performing the annotation together with an identifier.||||	||||For instance, GH:007 might be used to refer to the seventh such annotation made by a specialist from Gotham Hospital. (assuming the prefix GH has been registered with the HPO). ||||We have also included “ITM” to mark annotations retrieved by text-mining (inferred by text-mining).||||	||||Finally we have TAS, which stands for “traceable author statement”, usually reviews or disease entries (e.g. OMIM) that only refers to the original publication.",
